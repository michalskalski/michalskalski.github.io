Hello! I'm a software engineer specializing in cloud-native infrastructure and platform development.

My passion lies in tackling intricate technical problems and creating elegant solutions that make systems more reliable, efficient, and scalable. With over a decade in the technology space, my background spans work with SDN (Software-Defined Networking), OpenStack implementations, Kubernetes, and various infrastructure automation techniques. I've designed and developed Kubernetes controllers for networking solutions and lifecycle management, contributing to open-source projects along the way. I enjoy the challenge of making complex systems work seamlessly together, whether that's integrating third-party platforms or developing custom solutions for specific technical needs.

Currently, I'm working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and writing code in Go, leveraging these technologies to build robust platform solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring Tokyo on my bicycle, discovering new neighborhoods and enjoying the unique blend of traditional and modern aspects of Japanese life. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the broader tech community.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about technology!
